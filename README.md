# Rep Counter

This project was an attempt at sensor fusion using an IMU with an Arduino. The end goal of the project was to track RPE for movements while weightlifting. There are multiple versions of sensor fusion written here, with multiple different types of 9-axis IMUs, as specified in each INO file.
